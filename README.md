## Overview
This portfolio demonstrates the application of **Python, SQL, and NIST Frameworks** to modernize traditional audit workflows. It contains automation scripts for fraud detection and compliance testing, as well as governance artifacts for AI risk management.

## 📂 Project 1: Financial Fraud Detection (Python/Pandas)
**Objective:** Automate the identification of high-risk transactions using statistical analysis (Z-Score).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, SciPy.
- **Key Feature:** Analyzes 100% of transaction populations (vs. random sampling) to flag anomalies > 3 standard deviations from the mean.
- **File:** `Financial_Fraud_Detection/fraud_detection.py`

## 📂 Project 2: SOX User Access Review Automation
**Objective:** Reduce manual hours spent on SOX ITGC testing for User Access Reviews.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, CSV parsing.
- **Key Feature:** Automatically reconciles Active Directory logs against HR termination lists to identify unauthorized access instantly.
- **File:** `User_Access_Review/access_review.py`

## 📂 Project 3: AI Governance Risk Assessment
**Objective:** Establish a control framework for Generative AI adoption.
- **Framework:** NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0).
- **Key Feature:** A risk control matrix addressing Data Privacy (GDPR), Hallucinations, and Algorithmic Bias.
